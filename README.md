# Co-training algorithm on Educational Data Mining 
An implementation of the *Co-training* scheme, a well-known multi-view Semi-Supervised Learning approach, applied on Educational Data Mining datasets related with the task of Early Prognosis of Academic Performance is provided here.

Apart from the proposed algorithm **Cotrain(Extra, GBC)**, the results of several other variant of Co-training scheme are provided, as well as the results of *Self-training* approaches. Moreover, the results of the *CoForest* algorithm (implemented by  *Mr. Ming Li* lim@lamda.nju.edu.cn - [link](http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/code_CoForest.ashx)) have been computed for the same datasets' splits and same seeds.
